#Firebase in 2017

Almost two years ago I did a demo using Firebase. This time I am making use of the same database except I am using now Databinding to quickly update forms through binding.
This is the first phase and it's related to authentication.


This demo doesn't validate the form for books. If you want to find out more how to include validation with DataBinding, I explain it how in [my blog](http://www.juanmendez.info/2017/11/android-form-validation-with-mvvm.html)
