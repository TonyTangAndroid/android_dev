# jm_android_dev 

This is an ongoing learning and testing of many of the fundamentals in Android development. Some apps in here require still a bit of tweaks thought I try my best to complete everything, and use this repository as reference in stackoverflow or in my blog.

- March 25, 2017. [services demos](https://github.com/juanmendez/jm_android_dev/tree/master/10.services) are going away in exchange of [new repository](https://github.com/juanmendez/reviewing-services).

- October 20, 2017. [databinding](https://github.com/juanmendez/jm_android_dev/tree/master/08.feetWet/07.mvvm) demo went away for [learning Android Databinding](https://github.com/juanmendez/learning-android-databinding) repo.

- October 26, 2017. [AndroidJob](https://github.com/juanmendez/jm_android_dev/tree/master/12.alarms/00.simpleAlarm-AndroidJob!) new demo from a regular alarm project.

- December 14, 2017 [Firebase in 2017](https://github.com/juanmendez/jm_android_dev/tree/master/08.feetWet/08.firebase.2017) Times are changing and a demo done a long ago I couldn't even make it run anymore so I did it from scratch. 

- November 27, 2018 [Object Box](https://github.com/juanmendez/jm_android_dev/tree/master/09.database_connection/08.object_box) Reusing a Realm demo in this repo using instead [ObjectBox.io](https://objectbox.io/)
