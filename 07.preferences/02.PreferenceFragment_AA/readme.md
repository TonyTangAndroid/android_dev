# SharedPreferences with Android Annotations

This is a demo on how to use [`Android Annotations`](https://github.com/androidannotations/androidannotations) with SharedPreferences while having `PreferenceFragment` as a user interface.

Something which is very nice from [`Android Annotations`](https://github.com/androidannotations/androidannotations) is making `sharedPreferences` typed defined. [To find more about defined shared preferences](https://github.com/androidannotations/androidannotations/wiki/SharedPreferencesHelpers).
So preferences are part of a scope and they are given each their data types as well as default values if needed. This demo shows how to include `Android Annotations` sharedPreferences to a `PreferenceFragment`.

I have been using [`Android Annotations`](https://github.com/androidannotations/androidannotations) for a while, and I have to say aside from using [`Android Databinding`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html) it is one of my favorite tools. So most of these demos are a way for me to connect new ideas to working projects. It's also a way to discover how to do things in a new way for future projects.
