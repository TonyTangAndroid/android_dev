# Dialog PreferenceFragments

This is a demo to find out how to create `PreferenceFragments` in dialog mode which works for devices with an api level 21 and higher. Any devices with a lower level simply crash. I have made a new demo which actually worked.

I personally like the Dialog-PreferenceFragment when the options are just a few rather than using a regular fragment.
