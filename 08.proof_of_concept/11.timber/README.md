# Timber

This demo is inpired by Caster.io. I followed through with this awesome
way of tracing messages in my application.

It's very nice that you can filter out log types based on the build variants.

This demo has relase and debug variants. Debug variant is allowed to display all logs where as the release one only displays error types.
